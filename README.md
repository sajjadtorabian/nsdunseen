## NeuroHackademy 2022 Project
In this study, we investigate the neural representions of biological motion and social relationships using the Natural-Scenes-Dataset (NSD).

## Structure
- `annot_app`: this folder contains the jsPsych apps used for annotating the shared1000 images from NSD. 
- `subj01/behav`: this folder contains the original `responses.tsv` file from NSD, as well as the derived `final_response.tsv` which augments the `responses.tsv` with relevant CoCo labels and manual annotations.
- `subj01/TPJfunc.nii`: the TPJ mask obtained from MNI space, transformed into func1pt8 space of subject01 (see code [here](./transform.ipynb)).
